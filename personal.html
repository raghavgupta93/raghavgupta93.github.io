<p>Of late, I have been spending more and more time off YouTube/Facebook and pursuing more concrete interests. A bit more on each below.</p>

<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>I have been learning photography since getting my first camera nearly 2 years back. It is a pity I don't drive (yet) and, consequently, travel much, but I do try to take photos wherever I go.</p>

<p>As you can guess from the thumbnails below, these places are mostly cities. Also says a lot about what I like to take pictures of.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><a href="photos/boston.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/boston_thumb.jpg" /></a></td>
<td><a href="photos/nyc.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/nyc_thumb.jpg" /></a></td>
<td><a href="photos/sf.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/sf_thumb.jpg" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="photos/singapore.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/singapore_thumb.jpg" /></a></td>
<td><a href="photos/chicago.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/chicago_thumb.jpg" /></a></td>
<td><a href="photos/seattle.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/seattle_thumb.jpg" /></a></td>
<!-- <td><a href="photos/shanghai.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="photos/shanghai_thumb.jpg" /></a></td> -->

<p>There are some more photographs on my (sadly out-of-date) <a href="https://500px.com/raghavgupta3" target="_blank">500px profile</a>.</p>
<p><b>What's new here:</b> I purchased Photoshop and Lightroom, and am learning how to use the two properly instead of being slider-happy while retouching.</p>

<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Foreign languages hold the same allure to me as mysteries do to detectives. More than getting a door into a new culture, I am fascinated by the idea of speaking in a self-sufficient way of expression that somehow few around me can understand.</p> <p>My language endeavours have led me to formally study Spanish and Russian and Swahili, and most times when I am not working, I am beefing up my scores on <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/raghavgupta93" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>, which has to be my favorite website.</p>


As an aside, if you can read IPA, my name's pronunciation is very close to <b>/&#712;ra&#720;gh&#601;v &#712;g&#650;pta&#720;/</b>.
<p><b>What's new here:</b> 
<ul>
<li>Completed the Russian skill tree on Duolingo, and am proceeding to learn the old-fashioned way (which I still prefer, despite Duolingo's ease) from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Russian-Interactive-Online-Workbook/dp/0781812518/">this book</a>.
<li>Reached my daily peak of 1136 points on Duolingo. This is weird since I just started a new, and my very first, job.
<li>Empecé traducir esta página en español. И тоже на русском.
</ul></p>


<h3>Music</h3>
<p>While the piano is something I was exposed to and started playing during high school, I never got the chance to formally learn. While at Stanford, I took lessons from Timothy Zerlang at Stanford, and plan to continue learning.</p>
<p><b>What's new here:</b> Getting an upright piano once I end my three months of nomadism, in a month. Recommendations are welcome.</p>


<h3>Trivia</h3>
<p>As much as I realize my time is better spent elsewhere, my past as a passable quizzer has instilled in me a liking for trivia - especially of the I-could-never-have-known-that variety.</p>
<p><b>What's new here:</b> Did you know that <i>the only country that does not diplomatically recognize Armenia is actually not Azerbaijan, but its stauch ally Pakistan instead</i>?</p>
<!--<p><b>What I listen to:</b> I listen to lots of things. I have grown up on a diet of Hindi film music, and I still deeply enjoy Kishore Kumar of the yore, or the artistry of A.R. Rahman. However, I listen to more and more of progressive/melodic death metal these days. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgyzgV1HZ-g">Tool</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_DydLwYnUk">Soilwork</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rBoBBpFwB8">Opeth</a> are some bands I really like.</p>-->

<!--<p><b>What I watch:</b> I am passionate enough about movies to start with movie reviews were I to address my long-overdue objective of writing more. I generally enjoy intelligent/conversation-driven movies like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/">12 Angry Men</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/">The Man from Earth</a>, and also have a keen interest in world cinema - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3409392/">Timbuktu</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247586/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Nueve Reinas</a> are two of my favorites. All this while I wait for a horror movie other than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/?ref_=nv_sr_1">[REC]</a> to give me a real scare...
<p>Oh, and I have a blanket ban on TV series (no time) and anything classified as fantasy (no interest). Sorry, GoT/BB/HP/LotR fans.</p>-->
